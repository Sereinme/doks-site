I have to say that although this blog is to record the description of contributors, I actually use this as my categories or tags page.

Basically all we need is to create a new page in the `content` directory as follow, and make sure the `pwd` is the root folder.

```powershell
npm run create contributors/Sereinme/_index.md
```

And then change the metadata in the `_index.md` file, actually title and the body, like

```yaml

Good looking guy.

And check the preview, all the things done.
